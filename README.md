The graph shows the progression of the cumulative run over the overs for both India and the USA in their T20 World Cup match. Initially, both teams had a steady run rate, with India slightly ahead in the early overs. As the innings progressed, USA gained momentum and took the lead briefly around the middle overs. However, India accelerated their scoring in the later overs, surpassing the USA and maintaining the lead until the end. The key takeaway is India’s strong finish, which enabled them to secure the win by consistently increasing their run rate in the final overs.

The wickets timeline graph illustrates the distribution of wickets taken over the overs for both India and the USA. The USA lost wickets more frequently, especially in the early overs, with two wickets falling in the first over, followed by consistent wicket losses throughout their innings. In contrast, India experienced their wicket losses more evenly spread across their innings, with a couple of early wickets but maintaining longer partnerships in the middle overs. The frequent loss of wickets by the USA disrupted their momentum, while India’s ability to avoid clusters of wickets falling in succession helped them maintain a steady scoring rate and ultimately secure the win.

Notably, S. A. Yadav emerged as the highest scorer with a significant contribution, followed by NR Kumar and S. Dube. These three players were pivotal in their team’s innings, providing the bulk of the runs.

The bowling performance graph compares the economy rate and wickets taken by various bowlers in the match between India and the USA. Arshdeep Singh stands out as the most effective bowler, taking the highest number of wickets (4) with a commendable economy rate. Other notable performances include HH Pandya and SN Netravalkar, both taking 2 wickets each with moderate economy rates. Bowlers like S Dube, having a higher economy rate, contributed less in terms of wickets.

The partnership contributions graph for the USA highlights the runs scored by different batting pairs over each over. Key partnerships such as SR Taylor & Aaron Jones and NR Kumar & SR Taylor significantly boosted the scoring, particularly in the middle and late overs. However, the contributions are more sporadic compared to India, with several partnerships contributing only marginally.

The graph highlights the key moments in the USA’s innings, showing the progression of the cumulative run with wickets marked. Early wickets, such as those of Shayan Jahangir and AGS Gous in the first over, set back the USA’s momentum. Despite recoveries led by partnerships involving SR Taylor and NR Kumar, regular wickets in the middle and late overs, particularly around the 14th to 19th overs, hindered their progress. The dismissals of key players like Aaron Jones, SR Taylor, and later batsmen such as Harmeet Singh and CJ Anderson, prevented the USA from building a substantial and uninterrupted run flow, ultimately impacting their total score.

Despite an early setback with the dismissals of V. Kohli and RG Sharma in the first two overs, India managed to maintain a steady run rate. The wicket of RR Pant in the 7th over was another crucial moment, but subsequent partnerships helped stabilize the innings.

The comparison of average run rate per over shows that India had a higher average run rate of 5.84 compared to the USA’s 5.50. This indicates that India scored runs more efficiently throughout their innings. The higher run rate for India reflects their ability to maintain a steady flow of runs, despite early setbacks, which was crucial in achieving their target. The slightly lower run rate for the USA suggests they struggled to accelerate their scoring, especially in the middle overs, which impacted their overall total.

The USA experienced significant fluctuations in their run rate, with peaks in the 10th and 15th overs, but also several low-scoring overs, indicating inconsistency. India’s run rate was relatively more stable, with a notable increase towards the end of their innings. This stability in India’s run rate, especially in the death overs, allowed them to maintain pressure and chase the target successfully. The graph highlights India’s ability to keep a more consistent scoring pace, while the USA’s variable run rate reflects periods of struggle to maintain momentum.

**Summary**

In conclusion, India’s strategy of consistent scoring, effective partnerships, and a balanced bowling attack proved successful against the USA’s inconsistent batting performance and less impactful bowling. So, this is how you can analyze a cricket match and tell the story behind it as a Data Analyst/Scientist.
